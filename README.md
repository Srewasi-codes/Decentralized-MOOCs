# Decentralized MOOCs Platform

## Vision

The Decentralized MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) Platform aims to revolutionize online education by leveraging blockchain technology. By providing a transparent, secure, and decentralized system for course creation, enrollment, and certification, we empower instructors and students to engage in education without intermediaries, ensuring trust and authenticity in the learning process.

## Smart Contract Overview

This Solidity smart contract allows for the decentralized management of MOOCs. Instructors can create courses, students can enroll and complete them, and certifications are issued on the blockchain, making them verifiable and tamper-proof.

### Contract Address

- **Network**: Educhain
- **Contract Address**: 0x88B1305FefF0B8eA03DA7cD49c49659DA521ef06

### Key Features

- **Course Creation**: Instructors can create courses with specific details, including title, description, and price.
- **Enrollment**: Students enroll in courses by paying the required fee, directly benefiting the instructor.
- **Certification**: Instructors can issue certifications to students upon course completion, recorded on the blockchain.
- **Verification**: Anyone can verify the authenticity of a student's certification using the contract’s verification function.
- **Course Management**: Instructors have the ability to deactivate and reactivate courses.

## Future Scope

- **Decentralized Storage Integration**: Future iterations will include integration with IPFS or similar decentralized storage solutions for hosting course content securely.
- **Reputation System**: We plan to implement a reputation system for instructors and courses to enhance the decision-making process for students.
- **Token-Based Rewards**: A custom ERC-20 token system may be introduced to incentivize learning and teaching, rewarding students for achievements and instructors for high-quality courses.
- **Cross-Platform Certification**: Enable certification recognition across different educational platforms, creating a unified standard for decentralized learning credentials.
